Hello
-----

Thanks for checking out Pydoc.
This is a new ambitious project from the folks behind Read the Docs.

**This is currently in Beta!**
There is a lot of work that still needs to be done,
especially around the documentation UX and parsing.

You can read more information in our `About <{% url 'about' %}>`_ page.

So far we have built {{ view.projects.count }} projects.

You can find more packages by `searching for them <{% url 'search' %}>`_.
These are the latest packages we've built:
{% endfilter %}

{% for release in view.projects|slice:':10' %}
{% filter restructuredtext %}

* `{{ release.release_name }} </pypi/{{ release.release_name }}/index.html>`_

{% endfilter %}
{% endfor %}
