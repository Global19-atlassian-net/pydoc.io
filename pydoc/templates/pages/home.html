Hello
-----

Thanks for checking out Pydoc.
This is a new ambitious project from the folks behind Read the Docs.

Our plan is to build auto-generated API documentation for every package that is uploaded to PyPI.
This is similar to projects like http://rubydoc.info/ and https://godoc.org/ -- but for the Python community.
Once we have gotten all package in PyPI,
we hope to expand it to GitHub packages as well.

The primary thing that needed to happen for this project was the ability to parse Python documentation without importing the project.
Most Python tooling requires being able to import the project,
which is bad for a few reasons:

* It means you need to have all dependencies (including C libraries) installed on your system
* It executes arbitrary code
* It uses a lot more memory than a parse-only solution

**This is currently in Beta!**
There is a lot of work that still needs to be done,
especially around the documentation UX and parsing.

You can check out our listing of current projects that we're building here:

* `{{ project.name }} </media/docs/{{ project.name }}-{{ project.version }}/>`_
