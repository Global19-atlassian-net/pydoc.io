Welcome to Pydoc
================

Thanks for checking out Pydoc.

Below you will find the API documentation for Python packages that have been uploaded to PyPI.
We currently only support packages uploaded at wheels,
and that support Python 3.
This is the future of the ecosystem,
so we are supporting these formats first because we think they are best practices.

You can find more packages by `searching for them <{% url 'search' %}>`_.
