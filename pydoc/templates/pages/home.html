Hello
-----

Thanks for checking out Pydoc.
This is a new ambitious project from the folks behind Read the Docs.

**This is currently in Beta!**
There is a lot of work that still needs to be done,
especially around the documentation UX and parsing.

You can read more information in our `About <{% url 'about' %}>`_ page.

You can check out our listing of current projects that we're building here:

{% for project in view.projects %}
{% filter restructuredtext %}

* `{{ project }} </pypi/{{ project }}/index.html>`_

{% endfilter %}
{% endfor %}
